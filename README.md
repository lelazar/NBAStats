Advanced NBA Statistics Calculator

This is a calculator of some advanced NBA statistics. Hopefully it will be a whole calculator with EVERY possible formulas of the various statistics.
For help and explanation of the formulas, I am stealing the text from the page: https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html
But hey, it is only a home-made project! :)

At this moment, I am starting with a console application, but soon, it will have an own GUI with optional statistics to calculate, after the user inputs the required numbers.
